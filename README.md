Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting movement control due to the gradual loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. Common symptoms include tremors, stiffness, and difficulties with balance and coordination. Early detection is crucial for effective management. Ongoing research utilizes technologies like wearables and machine learning to analyze biometric markers, aiming to enhance early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.
People suffering from Parkinson’s disease have a lot of variations in their locomotive patterns. A diseased person would have a different kind of walking pattern, that is their stance and stride cycles will be different in relation to healthy people. Machine learning models were trained on the Vertical Ground Reaction Force data present of the two kinds of subjects which are Parkinsonian and Control subjects. The VGRF values were measured using sensors on both the foot of the subjects.
Parkinsonian Gait is the type of Gait exhibited by patients suffering from Parkinson’s Disease(PD). Gait is one of the most affected motor characteristics of this disorder. Patients with PD demonstrate reduced stride length, walking speed during free ambulation and cadence rate. The classification of a subject whether they are normal or have parkinson’s disease with the data of
Vertical Ground Reaction Force of the foot of the subjects which has been collected by 8 sensors placed on both foots of the subjects.
